        -       Education
        -       Personal

The expense tracker program should allow the user to see a weekly/ monthly/ yearly overview of expense.
In the overview section the user should have the ability to view:
        - Piechart/percentage category
        - Expense break down
        - Budget
        - Total Expendature
        - Amount left in Budget

Finally the program should allow the user to set a budget for each, week/month/year and be alerted if the expense made is over budget.
